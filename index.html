        <p>I was born in a small town named Temirtau in October 31, 1986. My country was Kazakhstan. And I lived there for 33 years. I finished local school, then I attended College and got my very first economical education. I liked to study and in
          the
          end of my 3 years education I got a diploma with excellent marks. After that I found my first job in the BTA Bank. I worked as a Credit Specialist. Meanwile I began to study at Univercity, where I studied for 3 years and finally I got my
          Bachelor's Degree, I became a professional Financial. Then I found my second job, where I have been working almost for 10 years, and I went all my professional way from Cashier till Chief Accountant. But in 2020 I with my family moved to Canada. And now I'm here and I want to become a professional Web Developer!!!</p>
